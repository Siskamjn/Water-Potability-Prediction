# Water-Potability-Prediction<br>

**Predicting Water Potability Using a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network**

This project focuses on building a Neural Network-based classification model to determine water potability. The dataset used contains various water quality parameters, and the goal is to predict whether the water is drinkable (potable) or not based on these features.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Develop a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network for water potability classification.
✅ Evaluate the model's performance and accuracy on the dataset.
✅ Analyze key features that influence water potability predictions.

🗂 **Dataset**
The dataset consists of 10 numerical attributes that measure different water quality parameters:<br>
pH: Water acidity/alkalinity level.<br>
Hardness: Mineral content in water.<br>
Solids: Total dissolved solids.<br>
Chloramines: Chloramine concentration.<br>
Sulfate: Sulfate concentration.<br>
Conductivity: Water’s electrical conductivity.<br>
Organic_carbon: Organic carbon content.<br>
Trihalomethanes: Trihalomethane concentration.<br>
Turbidity: Water clarity level.<br>
Potability (Target Variable): 1 (drinkable) and 0 (not drinkable).<br>

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
Python<br>
TensorFlow / Keras<br>
Scikit-Learn<br>
Pandas & NumPy<br>
Matplotlib & Seaborn<br>

📊 **Model Performance**<br>
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Feature importance analysis is also conducted to understand which attributes significantly impact water potability.
